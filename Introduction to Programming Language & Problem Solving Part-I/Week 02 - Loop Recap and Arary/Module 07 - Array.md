### In computer programming, an array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key. Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same data type in contiguous memory locations. The elements of an array can be accessed through their index or key, which allows for efficient traversal and manipulation of the elements.
