3. representation.
4. traversing method.
5. depth & height.


- representation (adj matrix,adj list,edges list).
- traverse (dfs,bfs).


- graph : non-linear data structure .a set of nodes(vertex/vertices) and edges  connected each other. 

- type 

-   Bipertite graph ( a graph where there are two separate groups of nodes, and every edge connects a node from Set A to a node from Set B. There are no edges directly connecting nodes within the same set. )

-   complete graph (it's a graph where every node is directly connected to every other node in the graph.)

```
Number of edges = n * (n - 1) / 2
Where "n" is the number of nodes in the graph.

```

-   rooted.unrooted.
```
Rooted Graph:
A rooted graph is a type of graph in which one node is designated as the "root" node. This root node serves as a starting point or reference point for analyzing the graph's structure. All other nodes in the graph are connected to the root node either directly or indirectly through a series of edges. The concept of hierarchy or direction is often associated with rooted graphs, as edges typically represent a directed relationship from the root node to other nodes.
A common example of a rooted graph is a tree data structure. In a tree, the topmost node (the root) has edges pointing to its child nodes, and each of those child nodes can have its own set of child nodes. The hierarchy is clearly defined from the root downward.

Unrooted Graph:
An unrooted graph, on the other hand, is a graph where no specific node is singled out as the root node. In an unrooted graph, all nodes are treated equally, and edges connect nodes without any inherent hierarchy or direction. This type of graph is often used to represent relationships where the order or direction of connections doesn't matter.
An unrooted graph is usually employed when analyzing relationships or connections that are symmetric and undirected, such as in molecular biology, where it might represent connections between atoms or elements without any notion of hierarchy.

In summary, the key distinction between rooted and unrooted graphs lies in whether a specific node is designated as the starting/reference point (root) for analysis. Rooted graphs typically have a hierarchical or directed structure with a defined root node, while unrooted graphs are used to represent symmetric and undirected relationships without any specific reference node.

```

-   DAG (directed acyclic graph)
```
Acyclic: The term "acyclic" means that the graph does not contain any cycles.

```

-   DCG (directed cyclic graph)

-   self loop (A self-loop graph is a type of graph where a node is connected to itself by an edge. In other words, there is an edge that starts and ends at the same node, forming a loop. Self-loops are a special type of edge that connects a node back to itself within the graph.)
-   example, we can message ourself in messenger

-   multi-edge (A multi-edge graph is a type of graph in which there can be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes. In other words, instead of having just one edge connecting two nodes, there can be several edges connecting them, each representing a distinct relationship, interaction, or connection.)
- example, google map .
```
A -- Message 1 --> B
A -- Message 2 --> B
A -- Comment --> B

```
## representation - 

1. adjacency(pashapashi) matrix.(2d array) square matrix(row equal column) initially all values zero.

2. adjacency list 

3. edges list


## DFS (DEPTH FIRST SEARCH)

```
const int N = 1e5 + 5;
vector<int> adj[N];
bool visited[N];

void dfs(int u)
{
    // section 1
    // actions just after entering a node.
    visited[u]=true;
    cout<<"visition node : "<<u<<endl;
    for (int v : adj[u]) //u theke jader kache jaoa jy.
    {
        // section 2
        // action before entering a new neighbor/child;
        if(visited[v])continue;
        dfs(v);
        // section 3
        // actions after exiting a neighbor.
    }

    // section 4
    // actions before exiting node u
}

```

## depth/height 

```
depth[child]=depth[par]+1;
dfs(child);
height[par]=max(height[par],height[child]+1);

```
