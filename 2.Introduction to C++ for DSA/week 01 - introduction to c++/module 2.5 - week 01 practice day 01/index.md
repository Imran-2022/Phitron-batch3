## custom problem for practice 

**Question 1:**

At first, in the main function, take an integer N as input. Then make a function named `get_array()` which will receive that N as a parameter. Then, inside the `get_array()` function, create an integer array of size N. Then, the values of that array will be taken as input. After that, return that array from that function and receive it in the main function and print the values of the array there.

Sample Input | Sample Output
------------ | -------------
5 | 1 2 3 4 5
1 2 3 4 5 |
7 | 5 1 2 4 6 9 3
5 1 2 4 6 9 3 |

**Question 2:**

Take an integer array A of size N as input. Then, take an integer M as input. You need to take an array B of size M and copy all elements of array A to array B. Delete the array A and then take input of the rest of the elements of array B. After that, print array B.

Sample Input | Sample Output
------------ | -------------
5 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
1 2 3 4 5 |
10 |
6 7 8 9 10 |
3 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 60 40
10 20 10 |
5 |
60 40 |
