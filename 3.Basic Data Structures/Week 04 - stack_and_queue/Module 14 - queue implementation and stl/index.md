# Queue

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It means that the element added first will be the first one to be removed. Think of it as a line of people waiting - the person who arrives first is the first one to leave.

## Queue Operations

A queue supports the following basic operations:

1. **Enqueue/Push**: Add an element to the back (end) of the queue.
2. **Dequeue/Pop**: Remove the element from the front (front) of the queue.
3. **Front/Peek**: Get the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Check if the queue is empty.
5. **Size**: Get the number of elements currently in the queue.
