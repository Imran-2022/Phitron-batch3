# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It means that the element added last will be the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates - you can only add or remove plates from the top.

## Stack Operations

A stack supports the following basic operations:

1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.
3. **Peek/Top**: Get the value of the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
4. **isEmpty**: Check if the stack is empty.
5. **Size**: Get the number of elements currently in the stack.

## Stack Implementation

1. **we learn about stack, when and how to use stack and why**
2. **stack implement uisng dynamic array**
3. **stack implement using list**
4. **stack implement using doubly linkedlist**
5. **stack stl library**


## brief

1. ADT - Abstract data structure.
2. LIFO - last in first out. /first in last out.
